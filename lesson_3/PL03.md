### Fork, join

Differences between fork-join and two initial blocks:
initial is static (processes are predefined* when you run a simulation)
fork-join is a dynamic (processes are created and killed dyncamically)

initial begin
    ...
    if(a == 10)
        fork
            ...
        join
end

#### 1. fork starts when all parent process (initial block) assignments done (here: a = 5):
```
initial begin
    fork
        a = 10;
    join_none

    a = 5;
    #1;
end
$display("a = \%d" a);
```
> a = 10;

#### 2. Or when parent process killed
```
initial begin
    fork
        #7 a = 10;
    join_none
end
```

#### 3. Or when timeslot changed
